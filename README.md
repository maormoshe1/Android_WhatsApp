# Android_WhatsApp
The page where the app opens is
the login page
You can switch between the registration page
and the login page with the appropriate buttons
On these pages there is a button at the top
that leads to the settings page
On the settings page you can change the server
in front of which the application works
The default server is: 10.0.2.2:5132
After logging in or registering, the Contacts page opens
On this page you can click on a contact
and go to the chat page with him
Also below is a button that opens a page
for adding a contact

Unfortunately we were unable to get the message
to appear right after it was sent
But you have to return back and enter again to the chat twice
so that you can see all the messages on the chat screen
