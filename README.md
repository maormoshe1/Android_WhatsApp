Before using the program, run the server...

The page where the app opens is
the login page
You can switch between the registration page
and the login page with the appropriate buttons
On these pages there is a button at the top
that leads to the settings page
On the settings page you can change the server
in front of which the application works
The default server is: 10.0.2.2:5132
After logging in or registering, the Contacts page opens
On this page you can click on a contact
and go to the chat page with him.
Also in the Contacts page below is a button
that opens a page for adding a contact.
If you insert an invalid or unavailable server
after a few seconds it will alert you
(For other things the alert will be immediate)

Unfortunately we were unable to get the messages
immediately In the transition between chats
you have to perform a refresh (exit and login to some page)
so that you can see all the messages on the chat screen.
Also, if you switch between users,
you will see the contacts that exist in Room
just after refresh you will see the real data
that exis on the server
